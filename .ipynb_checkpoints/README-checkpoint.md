# Quantitiative Financial Analysis Using Pandas

## Background


Quantitative analysis techniques with Python and Pandas, to determine which portfolio is performing the best across many areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.

I have created a tool (an analysis notebook) that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas, and determine which portfolio outperformed the others. I have used the historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds. I then used this analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compared its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P 500).
