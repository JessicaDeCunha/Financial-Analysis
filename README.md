# Quantitiative Financial Analysis Using Pandas

## Background


Quantitative analysis techniques with Python and Pandas, to determine which portfolio is performing the best across many areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.

I have created a tool (an analysis notebook) that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas, and determine which portfolio outperformed the others. You will be given the historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds. You will then use this analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P 500).
In this homework assignment, you will be accomplishing three main tasks:

Read in and Wrangle Returns Data
Determine Success of Each Portfolio
Choose and Evaluate a Custom Portfolio
